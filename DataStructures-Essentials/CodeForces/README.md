#  Notes and Explanation
Q: Why do we need `cols--` when `mod==0` in the following algorithm
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::string;
using std::endl;
int main(int argc, char** argv){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        int i = 1;
        int len = s.length();
        while(i < len && s[i]<=57 )i++;
        if(i < len && i > 1){
            int cols(0);
            i+=1;
            int j=i;
            while(j<len){
                cols = cols * 10 + s[j] - '0';
                j++;
            }
            string inOtherNotation = "";
            while(cols>0){
                int mod = cols%26;
                if(mod!=0){
                    inOtherNotation.insert(0,1,cols%26+'A'-1);
                }else{
                    inOtherNotation.insert(0,1,'Z');
                    cols--;
                }
                
                cols/=26;
            }
            
            cout<<inOtherNotation<<s.substr(1,i-2)<<endl;
        }else{
            i = 0;
            while(s[i]>57)i++;
            string part1 = s.substr(0,i);
            long cols = 0;
            int base = 0;
            for(int j=part1.length()-1;j>=0;j--){
                cols+=(part1[j]-'A'+1)*pow(26,base++);
            }
            cout << "R"<<s.substr(i,s.length())<<"C"<<cols<<endl;
            
        }
        
    }
}
```

A::
### Why cols-- is Needed
When mod == 0, the algorithm inserts 'Z' but needs to adjust the cols value to account for the zero remainder:

Without cols--, the division would incorrectly proceed to the next higher value (e.g., 52 -> 2 when it should handle 'AZ' as 52).
By decrementing cols, the algorithm correctly handles the carry-over for a complete cycle.

### Example Breakdown
Consider converting column number 52 to its Excel-like notation:

- Initial cols = 52
- mod = 52 % 26 = 0 (indicating 'Z')
- Insert 'Z', then cols-- results in cols = 51
- cols /= 26 now becomes 1
- Next iteration: mod = 1 % 26 = 1 (indicating 'A')
- Insert 'A', resulting in "AZ"

Without cols--, the process would misinterpret the complete cycle.

### Conclusion
The cols-- adjustment ensures that the column conversion correctly handles the end-of-cycle case where 'Z' should be represented, maintaining the proper progression of column letter sequences. This step aligns with how spreadsheet software typically handles column labels.

Q:: What is the purpose of `#include <utility>` header?

A: The `#include <utility>` header in C++ provides utility components that are widely used in various parts of the C++ Standard Library and user code. It contains several utility classes and function templates that provide general-purpose functionality. Here are some of the key components defined in the `<utility>` header:
1. `std::pair`: This class template is used to represent a pair of values of potentially different types. It is widely used in associative containers like `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, as well as in various algorithms and data structures.
2. `std::make_pair`: This is a convenience function template that creates a `std::pair` object from two values.
3. `std::swap`: This function template swaps the values of two objects.
4. `std::move`: This function template is used for efficient move semantics in C++11 and later. It creates an rvalue reference to an object, allowing it to be moved instead of copied.
5. `std::forward`: This function template is used in conjunction with `std::move` to perform perfect forwarding of arguments in function templates.
6. `std::declval`: This function template is used to obtain a reference to a temporary object of a specified type. It is primarily used in code involving expression templates and metaprogramming.
7. `Type traits`: The `<utility>` header also includes various type traits, such as `std::is_name`, `std::is_const`, `std::remove_reference` and `std::remove_const`, which provides compile-time information about types.
8. `std::integer_sequence`: This class template represents a sequence of integers at compile-time, which is useful for template metaprogramming.
9. `std::index_sequence`: This is an alias for `std::integer_sequence<size_t, ...>` which is commonly used in variadic template expansions.

The `<utility>` header is widely used throughout the C++ Standard Library and user code, providing general purpose utilities that simplify common programming tasks and enable more efficient and expressive code. It is considered an essential header for many C++ programs.
