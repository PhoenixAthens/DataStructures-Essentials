# Explanations and Notes
Q1: Explanation of the following code
```C++
//#include <iostream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
using std::ios_base;
using std::string;
int main(int argc, char** argv){
    //faster cin/cout
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int n = s.length();
    
    vector<vector<int>> pref(n+1, vector<int>(26));
    //pref[5][0] = occurences of 'a' in s[0..4]
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        pref[i+1] = pref[i]; // copy all 26 values
        int char_id = s[i] - 'a'; // value 0..25
        pref[i+1][char_id]++;
    }
    
    //read queries
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    for(int i = 0; i < q; i++){
        int L, R;
        cin >> L >> R; //0-based
        char best_char = '?';
        int best_freq = -1;
        for(int char_id = 0; char_id < 26; char_id++){
            int freq = pref[R+1][char_id] - pref[L][char_id];
            if(freq > best_freq){
                best_freq = freq;
                best_char = 'a' + char_id;
            }
        }
        cout << best_char << "\n";
    }
}

```
A:
```C++
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
```
These lines are used to improve the performance of `cin` and `cout` operations. `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)` disables the synchronization between C and C++ standard streams, and `cin.tie(0)` unties `cin` from `cout`, allowing them to work independently.
```C++
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int n = s.length();
```
This code reads a string `s` from the user input using `cin >> s`, and then calculates the length of the string nad stores it in the variable `n`.
```C++
    vector<vector<int>> pref (n+1, vector<int>(26));
    //pref[5][0] = occurences of 'a' in s[0..4]
```
This line creates a 2D vector `pref` of size `(n+1) x 26`. The outer vector represents the length of the prefix, and the inner vector represents the count of each character ('a' to 'z') in that prefix. The comment explains that `pref[5][0]` will store the number of occurences of the character 'a' in the substring `s[0..4]`.
```C++
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        pref[i+1] = pref[i];        //copy all 26 values
        int char_id = s[i] - 'a';   //value 0..25
        pref[i+1][char_id]++;
    }
```
This loop iterates over the string `s` and builds the `pref` vector. For each character `s[i]`, it first copies the previous row of `pref` (i.e., `pref[i]`) to the current row `pref[i+1]`. Then, it calculates the character index `char_id` by subtracting the ASCII value of `a` from the current character. Finally, it increments the count of that character in the current row (`pref[i+1][char_id]++`).
```c++
    //read queries
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    for(int i = 0; i < q; i++){
        int L, R;
        cin >> L >> R; //0-based
    }
```
This code reads the number of queries `q` from the user input, and then iterates `q` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `L` and `R` representing the range of the substring for which the most frequent character needs to be found. The comment indicates that the indices are 0-based.
```C++
    char best_char = '?';
    int best_freq = -1;
    for(int char_id = 0; char_id < 26; char_id++){
        int freq = pref[R+1][char_id] - pref[L][char_id];
        if(freq > best_freq){
            best_freq = freq;
            best_char = 'a' + char_id;
        }
    }
    cout << best_char << "\n";
```
For each query range `[L, R]`, the code initializes `best_char` to `'?'` and `best_fraq` to `-1`. Then, it iterates over all possible characters (`'a'` to `'z'`) using `char_id`. For each character, it calculates the frequency `freq` of that character in the substring `s[L..R]` by subtracting the count of the character in the prefix `s[0...L-1]` (stored in `pref[L][char_id]`) from the count of the character in the prefix `s[0..R]` (stored in `pref[R+1][char_id]`). If the calculated frequency `freq` is greater than the current `best_freq`, it updates `best_freq`  and `best_char` accordingly. Finally, it prints the `best_char` for the given range.

Let's take an example to understand the algorithm better:

Say, we are given a string `"abcccabaaabb"` of length 12. What our  algorithm will do here is the following:
1. First we will create a 2D `vector` of size `13`, where each element in the vector stores an array of size `26`. 
2. Next, we'll iterate through our string and for each character in the array, we'll first copy the array at previous index in the 2D vector to the current, and increment element at index corresponding to the character in the inner array. This will result in the following 2D vector 
```text
s = "abcccabaaabb"
[ 
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 4, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 5, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [ 5, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]
```
Once we have the above 2D vector, we can use a for-loop for each query to find the character that occurs most often.
